# C++ Learning

In this project, there are extensive tasks to learn C++.

## **[cpp00](cpp_modul_00/README_cpp00.md): Introduction to C++**
- **Goal:** Familiarity with the basics of C++ programming.
- **Focus:** Understanding syntax, writing simple programs.

## **[cpp01](cpp_modul_01/README_cpp01.md): Memory and Pointers**
- **Goal:** Understanding memory management and the use of pointers.
- **Focus:** Efficient use of memory, debugging memory issues.

## **[cpp02](cpp_modul_02/README_cpp02.md): Classes and Objects**
- **Goal:** Introduction to object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++.
- **Focus:** Basic understanding of OOP, designing classes.

## **[cpp03](cpp_modul_03/README_cpp03.md): Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- **Goal:** Deepening OOP concepts through inheritance and polymorphism.
- **Focus:** Understanding and applying polymorphism, designing more complex OOP structures.

## **[cpp04](cpp_modul_04/README_cpp04.md): Templates and Exception Handling**
- **Goal:** Introduction to advanced C++ concepts like templates and error handling.
- **Focus:** Creating flexible and robust programs, efficient error handling.

## **[cpp05](cpp_modul_05/README_cpp05.md): Exception Handling and Nested Classes**
- **Goal:** How to handle runtime errors and creating speacial errors and structed with nested classe.
- **Focus:** Implementing try, catch, and throw for robust error handling, understanding exception safety, and working with nested classes to encapsulate logic.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To get started with the projects, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, CLion)
- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax and programming concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ELREKO/cpp_Lerning.git
   cd cpp_Lerning
   ```

   Switch to the desired exercise `cpp_modul_00` - `cpp_modul_04`
   **For example:**
   ```bash
   cd cpp_modul_00
   ```

#### Further Information can be found in the respective exercise

- **[cpp00](cpp_modul_00/README_cpp00.md)**
- **[cpp01](cpp_modul_01/README_cpp01.md)**
- **[cpp02](cpp_modul_02/README_cpp02.md)**
- **[cpp03](cpp_modul_03/README_cpp03.md)**
- **[cpp04](cpp_modul_04/README_cpp04.md)**
- **[cpp05](cpp_modul_05/README_cpp05.md)**
