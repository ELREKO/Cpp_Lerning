# C++ Learning

In this project, there are 38 different exercises from 42 School to learn the full scope of C++.
All exercises were compiled and tested on macOS `Catalina 10.15.7` and `Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS`.
All of these exercises are compilable with the `-std=c++98` flag, since this was a requirement for this project.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To get started with the projects, you will need:

- A C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`)
- A code editor or IDE (e.g., VSCode, CLion)
- Basic knowledge of C++ syntax and programming concepts

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ELREKO/cpp_exercise.git
   cd cpp_exercise
   ```

   Switch to the desired exercise `cpp_modul_00` - `cpp_modul_09`.
   
   **For example:**
   ```bash
   cd cpp_modul_00
   ```
